# Toolkid.GridInventory

This repository provides a grid-based inventory system implemented using Unity's `Grid` component, inspired by the inventory system in the popular **Diablo series**.

# Sharp Editor

`Sharp` allows you to set the shape and quantity of items when storing them.

## Usage

1. Add `Placeables` to the inventory object.
2. Click on the grid square you want to configure (currently limited to a size of 5Ã—5).
3. Utilize scripts to call relevant methods from `InventoryManager`.
4. Setup `Grid` parammeters by `GridSystem` on **Inspector**.
